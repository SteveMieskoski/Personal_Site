# Introduction
I built this site as a my personal site, and as a first investigation of jquery.  To add some additional flare and a challenge I threw three.js combined into the mix with tween.js to power the 3D elements and animation.  In particular I based this project on the periodic table example from three.js demonstrating the CSS3DRenderer.  From there I threw some additional three.js elements into the mix with ajax calls to recreate SPA type behavior. 


## Here is a breakdown of the technologies/libraries used: 
- Vanilla Javascript
- jQuery 
- AJax 
- Three.js 
- Webpack 
- require.js (prior version)
