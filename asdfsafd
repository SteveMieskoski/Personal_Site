Name servers

Name servers store the configuration of your domain as a collection of resource records. If you use the Google Domains name servers, you can use the rest of this page to configure your domain. Alternately, you can enter up to 12 custom name servers here and configure your domain with your third-party DNS provider. Learn more

Registered hosts

Register public hosts on your domain by IP address so they can be found without first resolving your domain in the DNS. Entries here are commonly called "glue records" and are needed when a domain's name servers serve on one of its subdomains.
