<h2 class="h2-page-content">ABOUT ME</h2>

<div class="messageAttach"></div>

<p >My name is Steven Mieskoski and iâ€™m a programmer.</p>



<p>While I am strongest with javascript, I prefer strongly typed structure to the loosely typed structure of either javascript or python, and believe this will continue as I gain proficiency in additional languages.  That being said choosing the right tool for the job is essential.  So, with that in mind I choose python when it comes to analysis, java for the desktop or stability, and javascript for the web and niche applications based upon the expansive open source options.</p>
<p>As the strengths, weaknesses, and offerings vary within any language, the various frameworks, libraries, and associated communities available within a language must also come under consideration.  In combination with additional considerations such as choosing a NoSQL, a traditional RSDB, or some other offering.  Each having its use depending on usage requirements and restrictions.  For example if concurrent operations could endanger data integrity, an ACID compliant RSDB beats a NoSQL which may only use a best effort approach.</p>
<p>I am personally interested in data science generally, and more specifically the realm of machine learning.  Further, I am also strongly interested in economics and finance. In addition to physics, the field of my degree.  In general I am interested in areas of logical analysis which also happen to contain significant challenges.  Ultimately my interest in drawn toward these challenges whether fundamental or implementation.  The joy of finding a solution never gets old.</p>
<p>Beyond coding, computing, and the like I enjoy biking, skiing, and good old backyard fun.  I am generally candid except when circumstances require otherwise, and in those cases I otherwise provided the necessary circumspect presentation.  And while I am candid and generally jovial, I am also quite serious, and not just when required but always when it comes to the project, task, and ultimately the final work product.</p>



<!--<p >One could say I look at life as a continual moonshot, if I'm not pushing my boundaries into the unknown then I feel like I'm doing something wrong.  Maybe this mentality drew me to my career in patents with a desire to witness the future invented, but law isn't a profession where this mentality thrives.  Thus I took it upon myself to gain fluency where previously only a partial understanding existed. Starting with python known to me as a language widely used in science I  began to learn the structure and mentality of programming.  I ended my python education with Django, and segued into languages of the web.  In particular, JavaScript and it's derivative TypeScript, along with HTML and CSS.  I quickly found I quite enjoyed these web languages.  Finding Something about the ability to create something 'tangible' invigorating while simultaneously enjoying providing the challenges associated with making the doohickey do it's doohickey-ing satisfied me.</p>

<p >I have taken the time to not only learn the basics, but to gain understanding with depth of the languages I've studied.  Providing more than a foundation, but a practical understanding acquired both via personal experience and investigations to solve problems I've encountered.  In an ever increasing manner I have gained the tools to perform the same operation by multiple means depending on the circumstances and requirements.</p>-->

<!--
<p>It was near the end of my first semester of law school that I became increasingly convinced that the path of law did not suit me and felt the need to return to a paradigm closer to the thought patterns that drew me to my original degree of physics and science. One of problem solving rather than argument creation. This epiphany moment awakened a dormant interest in computers, programming, and technology in general.</p>

<p>I knew self educating myself in programming would take patience and intense, dedicated study but was well within reach thanks to my experience learning physics in college and subsequent self education to pass the patent bar (registration exam) to obtain my status as a registered patent agent.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I also had a base of knowledge to leverage from my use of mathematica, matlab, and some C++ in college. Despite that knowledge being specifically directed toward numerical computations and modeling, it was a beneficial gateway that helped me gain the understanding I have today and helped me build the site you view now. </p>-->
